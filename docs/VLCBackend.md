# VLCBackend Implementation

## Overview

The VLCBackend class provides libVLC integration for the Cross-Platform Media Player. It implements both the IMediaEngine and IComponent interfaces, providing secure media playback with sandboxed decoding.

## Features

- **Comprehensive Format Support**: Supports all formats supported by libVLC
- **Hardware Acceleration**: Automatic detection and fallback to software decoding
- **Security**: Sandboxed decoding with file validation and size limits
- **Event-Driven**: Real-time state, position, and error reporting
- **Thread-Safe**: Mutex-protected state management
- **Component Integration**: Full integration with ComponentManager lifecycle

## Architecture

### Class Hierarchy
```
VLCBackend : public IMediaEngine, public IComponent
├── Media playback functionality (IMediaEngine)
├── Component lifecycle management (IComponent)
├── libVLC instance management
├── Event handling and callbacks
└── Security validation and sandboxing
```

### Key Components

1. **libVLC Integration**: Direct integration with libVLC C API
2. **Event System**: Callback-based event handling with Qt signal emission
3. **Security Layer**: File validation, extension checking, size limits
4. **State Management**: Thread-safe playback state tracking
5. **Error Handling**: Comprehensive error reporting with MediaError types

## Usage Example

```cpp
// Create and initialize VLC backend
auto vlcBackend = std::make_shared<VLCBackend>();
if (vlcBackend->initialize()) {
    // Load and play media
    if (vlcBackend->loadMedia("/path/to/media.mp4")) {
        vlcBackend->play();
    }
}
```

## Security Features

- File extension validation (configurable whitelist)
- Maximum file size limits (default: 10GB)
- Path traversal prevention
- Sandboxed decoding options
- Input sanitization for URLs and file paths

## Requirements

- libVLC 3.0.0 or higher
- Qt 6.0 or higher
- C++17 compiler support

## Testing

Run the VLC backend tests:
```bash
./MediaPlayerTests
```

## Implementation Status

✅ **Completed (Task 2.1)**:
- VLCBackend class with libVLC instance management
- Media loading and basic playback functions
- libVLC initialization, cleanup, and error handling
- Media state tracking and event callbacks
- Sandboxed decoding for security
- Component integration with ComponentManager
- Comprehensive test coverage
- Example program demonstrating usage

## Next Steps

The VLCBackend foundation is complete and ready for integration with:
- PlaybackController (Task 2.2)
- Hardware acceleration detection (Task 2.3)
- Advanced playback features (Task 2.4)
- File and URL support enhancements (Task 2.5)
